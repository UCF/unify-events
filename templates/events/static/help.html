            <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="http://{{ request.get_host }}">{{ request.get_host }}</a> is the online location for listing and promoting UCF events. 
                The UCF events system makes it easy for you to create events listings and share events with the UCF community. Any 
                occurrence that has a start date and specific location can be entered as an event. A carefully constructed title, start 
                date &amp; time, category and location are all required for submitting an event into the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intuitive administrative console makes publishing events and calendars on your website simple; or you can recommend 
                an event for publication on the main site. If your website promotes UCF events - including lectures, receptions, speakers, 
                meetings, and shows, the UCF events system can help your users find this information and easily add it to their own 
                calendars. Hereâ€™s what you can do with the new UCF events system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get a unique events calendar for yourself or your UCF organization</li>
                <li>Add, edit, and manage your upcoming events</li>
                <li>Recommend events for posting on the main UCF web site</li>
                <li>Share events with other organizations on campus</li>
                <li>Display a calendar on your site</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As with any IT system at UCF, use of the Events System is governed by the 
                <a href="http://policies.ucf.edu/documents/4-002UseofInformationTechnologiesandResourcesFINAL.pdf">
                    Division of Information Technologies and Resources Use of Information Technology and Resources Policy.
                </a> 
                Please be sure you have reviewed and understand this policy before logging in and entering content in the Events System.

            <p>
                To create new events, you'll need to <a href="{% url 'accounts-login' %}">log in</a> to the events system using your NID and 
                NID password.  If you've never used the events system before, using the login form will set up your events system account for you.
            </p>
            <div class="well">
                <p>
                    If you are unsure of what your NID is, you may look it up using the <a href="https://my.ucf.edu/nid.html">NID lookup tool</a>.  
                    If you don't know the password associated with that NID, you may reset it using the 
                    <a href="http://mynid.ucf.edu/">NID password reset tool</a>. You will need your UCF ID card to complete the password reset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have issues with retrieving your NID or resetting your password, please contact the Service Desk at 407-823-5117.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                First time users will be guided through a two-step setup process to confirm user settings and create a first calendar.  Users that
                used the previous version of the events system will have all their events and settings copied over, and will not see this walkthrough
                when they log in.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you've finished the initial setup process, you'll be directed to your Manager View.  If you didn't create a new calendar in the 
                second step, you can either create one here, or request to be added to an existing calendar as an administrator or editor.  Requests
                to be added to a calendar should be handled outside of the events system; contact the owner or an administrator of the calendar directly
                so that they can add you.
            </p>

            <h3 id="create-new-calendar">Create a New Calendar</h3>
            <p>
                Like the previous events system, all users require a calendar to be able to post events.  In the new events system, however, calendars
                are not directly tied to your NIDs, so you can have more than one calendar, or be an administrator or editor of another calendar that
                doesn't belong to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're a first time user, the second step of the first login process will ask you to create a new calendar.  You can create your first
                calendar during this step, or click <strong>My Calendars > Create New Calendar</strong> in the admin navbar later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calendars require a title; you can also add an optional description to tell users about the types of events on your calendar.
            </p>

            <h3 id="create-new-event">Create a New Event</h3>
            <p>
                If you are added to or own at least one calendar, you can create a new event.  Click the blue <strong>Create Event</strong> button in the
                admin navbar to get started.
            </p>

            <h4>Calendar</h4>
            <p>
                Select the calendar you want to post the event to.  Events must be posted to an existing calendar before they can be added to the Main Calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
                To recommend this event for Main Calendar approval, check the checkbox next to the Calendar select dropdown.
            </p>

            <h4>Title</h4>
            <p>
                Your event title should be unique, concise, and immediately recognizable to your audience.  Keep it simple.
            </p>

            <h4>Status</h4>
            <p>
                Before saving your event, you can determine whether or not the event will display on your front-facing calendar immediately.  To immediately
                publish it, select "posted"; to save the event without making it publically available in event listings, select "pending".
            </p>
            <p>
                For more information, see the help section on <a href="#event-statuses">Event Statuses</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
